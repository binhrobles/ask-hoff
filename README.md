A stab at using Deno and MS Teams Bots. Built using CDK + [a Deno Docker Lambda runtime](https://github.com/hayd/deno-lambda) to simplify building/deploying.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
